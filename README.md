Woojangchun Underpass location:   https://www.google.com/maps/place/%EC%9A%B0%EC%9E%A5%EC%B6%98%EC%A7%80%ED%95%98%EC%B0%A8%EB%8F%84/@35.2151336,129.0723631,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xbdc1958dec0e586a?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjsgYWmo_b6AhXIQPUHHaqZCkMQ_BJ6BAhOEAU 
  
Woojangchun underpass is located in Busan, South Korea. Flooding of the underpass has been a chronic problem during the rainy season in summers. 
This project is to accurately predict the water level of the underpass from June to August to help better prepare for and prevent damage.
  
Apart from the Woojangchun water level data acquired from the govenrment entity, various weather data of districts in Busan city such as *Suyoung-gu*, *Dongnae-gu Oncheon-2-dong*, *Dongnae-gu Oncheon-3-dong*, *Nakdong River Estuary Bank*, *Gupo bridge* have been collected using Open APIs like [Water Resource Management Information System](http://www.wamis.go.kr:8080/wamisweb/rf/w3.do#) and [Korea Meteorological Administration](https://data.kma.go.kr/data/rmt/rmtList.do?code=400&pgmNo=570).
